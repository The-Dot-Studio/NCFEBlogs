  At NCFE, our guiding principle is clear and straightforward: ‘Inspire
  Excellence and Ignite Success.’ This isn’t just a slogan for us—it’s a
  commitment. Our mission is to nurture students into active and caring learners
  with a global perspective. As one of the [best schools in
  Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/ "best schools in Bangalore"), we are
  dedicated to creating an environment where children are encouraged not only to
  absorb knowledge but also to embrace curiosity and develop a lifelong passion
  for learning. This approach ensures that our students are not only
  well-prepared academically but also thoughtful individuals who care about
  making a positive impact.


  Our alumni are the living testament to the values we provide as the [top
  school in CV Raman Nagar](https://ncfeschools.com/cv-raman-nagar "top school
  in CV Raman Nagar"). These former students are now making meaningful
  differences in the world. Their paths show that the lessons learned at NCFE
  extend beyond the classroom walls. They’re facing life’s challenges with the
  skills and values they picked up at NCFE. Through their stories, we can see
  the real-world impact of our approach to education, highlighting our
  dedication to preparing students for life, not just academics.


  Kusumitha, who graduated from NCFE in 2016, is a prime example of where our
  education can lead. She is currently pursuing a PhD in Agriculture
  Biotechnology at the University of Queensland, focusing on biotechnology and
  agriculture. This achievement speaks to our teaching methods—making lessons
  interactive and practical. Our teachers, best among the [top CBSE schools in
  East Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com "top CBSE schools in East Bangalore"),
  prioritise a hands-on learning approach, utilising practical examples to
  ensure students don’t just memorise facts, but understand and apply their
  knowledge. This method of teaching helps develop a solid base in each subject,
  making lessons engaging and relevant to real-world situations.


  Such an approach to education, focusing on practicality and application,
  prepared Kusumitha well for her advanced studies and research in biotechnology
  and agriculture. It’s the kind of preparation that the [best CBSE schools in
  Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/cv-raman-nagar "best CBSE schools in
  Bangalore") aim for all the students, emphasising the importance of strong
  fundamental knowledge alongside theoretical learning. We aim to equip them
  with the knowledge and skills they need, not just for academic success, but
  for life.


  Our commitment to a holistic education that goes beyond just learning from
  books makes us one of the [top rated schools in
  Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/cv-raman-nagar "top rated schools in
  Bangalore"). Take Pratik, for example, an NCFE alumnus whose passion for
  theatre has flourished into a successful career. Over the past six years,
  Pratik has contributed to more than 20 short films while completing his degree
  in Mumbai, a journey that started in our school. Pratik didn’t just absorb the
  theoretical foundations of performing arts here; he was also counselled by our
  best CBSE school teachers on pursuing his dreams, armed with practical
  knowledge of the industry.


  Then there is the story of Simran Naik, an NCFE alumna who has made a name for
  herself in the legal world at Fox Mandal in Bengaluru, one of India’s leading
  law firms. Simran’s success is an example of how our extracurricular programs,
  highly distinguished among the [private schools in
  Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/mandur "private schools in Bangalore"),
  contribute significantly to the personal and professional growth of our
  students. During her time at NCFE, Simran was an active member of our debating
  society, which played a pivotal role in shaping her future. This experience
  was not just about debating; it was about nurturing the skills she would need
  in her legal career. Through regular participation in inter-school
  competitions among the [best rated schools in
  Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/cv-raman-nagar "best rated schools in
  Bangalore"), Simran enhanced her ability to research thoroughly, think
  critically, and articulate her arguments effectively. These skills now enable
  her to fulfil her responsibilities at her law firm and offer guidance to her
  clients.


  At NCFE, we believe in creating an environment where students like Simran and
  Pratik can explore their talents beyond the classroom and measure their skills
  against students from various [schools in Bangalore
  city](https://ncfeschools.com/indiranagar "schools in Bangalore city"). They
  learn to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios, building a strong
  foundation for their future careers. Simran's journey from a student in our
  debating society to a respected lawyer at a prestigious firm underscores the
  value of a well-rounded education—one that prepares students for the
  challenges and opportunities of the professional world.


  Besides encouraging co-curricular skills, we also emphasise nurturing other
  qualities that contribute to a child’s overall growth. At NCFE, we focus on
  fostering both creativity and critical thinking. Take Aditi Menon, for
  instance, another proud alumna of our school. She has made significant
  progress in her career and is now a successful licensed architect. She runs
  her own design studio, Studio 5ft. Her ability to create innovative spaces
  today can be traced back to the encouragement she received at our school to
  challenge conventional thinking and pursue her unique vision. This philosophy
  of empowering students to explore their passions has proven to be a
  cornerstone of success for our alumni.


  To sum up, our alumni like Kusumitha, Pratik, Simran, and Aditi show what
  NCFE, one of the [top CBSE schools](https://ncfeschools.com/ "top CBSE
  schools"), stands for. We’re not just teaching students; we’re preparing them
  for life, helping them grow their talents, and encouraging them to make a
  difference. We’re proud of where they are today and excited to see how they
  and future students will use what they learn here to navigate the world.
