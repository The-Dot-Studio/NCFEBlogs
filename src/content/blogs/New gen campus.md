  Kiran is a fourth-generation educator. While his father N Vijaya Kumar wanted
  to start only one school, Kiran, director of the National Centre for
  Excellence (NCFE) schools, believes in spreading the dream to more and [more
  people](https://ncfeschools.com/about-us). Under his leadership, Vijay Kiran
  Education Trust has set up its third campus in Mandur and also plans to set up
  a fourth one in Bengaluru North soon.


  "For me, the path was almost certain. For four generations, our family has
  been a group of educators. I was also set to follow the same footpath," Kiran
  said. After returning from the UK after his Masters, Kiran plunged into the
  activities of school. "Initially, my dad would make me sit and watch how the
  school was functioning. I would get trained from the grassroots level," he
  said. His sister Keerthi Vijayakumar handles the human resources side.


  "The greatest challenge was the old generation was focused on academic
  performance and rote learning. We had to transform towards a more holistic
  education with equal importance to factors such as emotional intelligence,
  extracurricular activities, having a more agile classroom, among others. We
  tried to cater to diverse needs of students and become more inclusive in
  nature," he shared.


  Schools governed by Kiran Vijayakumar: [NCFE CV Raman
  Nagar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27yjHPdAM4DFeDCYA), [NCFE
  Indiranagar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w2vHZ3cJr4mWC2A99), and [NCFE
  Mandur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V1fEUQ8gDmoGrkcY6), which together have about
  3,000 students


  Three things he is doing differently: My focus is to help students balance
  their digital learning with traditional pen-and-paper resources. Another key
  area of support is student well-being through mental health initiatives.
  Additionally, maintaining an active connection with parents regarding their
  child's learning progress is mandatory.


  What he is most concerned about today: The need for inclusive education. I'm
  dedicated to creating an environment where every student, regardless of his or
  her abilities, background, learning styles, or being differently abled, feels
  valued, supported, and able to reach his/her full potential.
