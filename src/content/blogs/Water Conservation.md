  ”Be the change you wish to see in the world”- Mahatma Gandhi


  As educators, it's our responsibility to secure a brighter future for our
  future generation and teach students to explore ways in which they can
  conserve water and contribute to a sustainable future. Of all the water
  present on Earth, only a fraction, less than 1%, is suitable for drinking. The
  United Nations reports that approximately 1.2 billion individuals worldwide
  currently experience water scarcity, with another 500 million edging towards
  this predicament. These statistics underscore the critical issue of water
  scarcity. Thus, it's important for students and their parents to make every
  effort to conserve water.


  Bengaluru is facing an unprecedented water crisis, leaving its residents
  struggling to get water for essential requirements. This drought-like scenario
  has impacted various sectors including industries, schools, fire departments,
  apartments, and hotels. Amidst one of its most severe water crisis in decades,

  "Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board") (BWSSB) issued an order saying
  that drinking water should not be used for non-potable purposes. BWSSB
  embarked on a strategy to conserve water by implementing supply cuts to big
  customers, targeting a saving of 60 million litres per day (MLD). Marathahalli
  is one of the areas which is affected by the shortage of water. So, [schools
  in Marathahalli](https://ncfeschools.com/indiranagar "schools in
  Marathahalli"), [schools in Kodigehalli](https://ncfeschools.com/mandur
  "schools in Kodigehalli") and schools in other affected areas are teaching
  students how to conserve water in school and at home.


  ### How to save water in schools


  Water conservation is a critical practice that should be embraced by everyone,
  including schools. By adopting water-saving measures, schools can contribute
  to preserving this precious resource while also setting an example for
  students.


  * Educate Students


  Education revolves around learning, hence sharing your discoveries on water
  conservation at school is an excellent approach to engage both staff and
  students, raise awareness, and encourage the adoption of water-saving
  practices. Every effort, regardless of size, contributes to making the school
  more water-efficient. All the [schools near Marathahalli
  Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/indiranagar "schools near Marathahalli
  Bangalore") are making sure to raise awareness among students about the water
  crisis and its conservation


  * Conduct Regular Inspections


  Assign a team to regularly inspect school premises for leaks, drips, and other
  plumbing issues. Check toilets, faucets, showers, and irrigation systems for
  any signs of leaks or inefficiencies.


  * Fix Leaks Promptly


  Promptly repair any leaks or drips to prevent water wastage. Train maintenance
  staff or volunteers to identify and address leaks as soon as they are
  detected.


  * Install Water-Efficient Fixtures


  Replace old toilets, faucets, and showerheads with water-efficient models that
  use less water without compromising performance.


  * Implement Water-Saving Practices


  Encourage students and staff to turn off taps tightly after use and report any
  leaks they notice. Ensure that irrigation systems are properly calibrated to
  avoid overwatering and water runoff


  * Promote Water Awareness Campaigns


  Organise water awareness campaigns and competitions to engage students in
  water-saving initiatives. Recognize and reward individuals or classes that
  contribute the most to water conservation efforts. At [NCFE Indiranagar
  Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/indiranagar "NCFE Indiranagar Bangalore"),
  we have a school initiative called “Green Generation” which involves students
  in activities that foster eco-friendly practices and teach conservation
  awareness.


  At [NCFE Bangalore](https://ncfeschools.com/ "NCFE Bangalore"), we teach
  students that by implementing these strategies, we can significantly reduce
  water wastage. Saving water not only benefits the school community but also
  contributes to a more sustainable future for generations to come. 


  ### How to Save Water at Home


  As parents, we must ensure a better future for our children. It is our
  responsibility to talk to children about an imminent water shortage or to
  involve them in conserving water for the future.


  * Involve kids in the decision-making


  When we anticipate an impending water crisis, it's wise to prepare ahead to
  avoid encountering severe shortages at home. Encourage children to propose
  methods for reducing water usage within the household. Often, children can
  offer remarkable ideas. Act upon their suggestions—this will motivate them to
  actively participate in water-saving endeavours.


  * Make kids aware of water supply


  When the water bill arrives, take the opportunity to educate children about
  the household's water consumption and encourage them to establish goals for
  reducing monthly usage. Show appreciation to children for their efforts in
  conserving water and contributing to lower family consumption. By doing so,
  the entire family will be better prepared with strategies to mitigate water
  usage during times of shortage.


  * Teach children not to waste water


  Amidst the ongoing Bangalore water crisis, tell children about the scarcity of
  water and the importance of using it wisely. Encourage them to take brief
  showers, avoid leaving taps running while brushing their teeth, ensure all
  taps are tightly closed, and use a low-flow setting when washing hands or
  faces. Teach children to pour only half a glass of drinking water when
  thirsty, taking more only if necessary. Additionally, collect water used for
  cleaning vegetables and encourage children to use it for watering plants.


  * Saving Rainwater


  Implementing a rainwater collection system in home or apartment complexes is a
  significant move in water preservation, especially during water scarcity. To
  instil the importance of rainwater in children, encourage them to place a
  bucket outside during rainfall and utilise the collected water for cleaning
  and washing tasks. [NCFE CV Raman Nagar
  Campus](https://ncfeschools.com/cv-raman-nagar "NCFE CV Raman Nagar Campus")
  has an [Environment
  Club](https://ncfeschools.com/cv-raman-nagar-co-scholastics "Environment
  Club"), where students get engaged in sustainability projects and green
  practices.


  ### Conclusion


  In conclusion, water conservation is a crucial endeavour that must be pursued
  both at school and at home. By incorporating water-saving practices into our
  daily routines, such as fixing leaks, utilising efficient appliances, and
  adopting rainwater harvesting systems, we can collectively make a significant
  impact on preserving this precious resource for future generations. Educating
  ourselves and our children about the importance of water conservation ensures
  that this essential message resonates throughout our communities. Together,
  through our combined efforts in schools and households, we can strive towards
  a sustainable future where access to clean water remains a fundamental right
  for all. Let us pledge to continue our commitment to water conservation, not
  only for the well-being of our planet but also for the prosperity of
  generations to come.
